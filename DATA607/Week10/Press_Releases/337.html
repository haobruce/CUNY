<p>11 June 2010</p>

<p>The 2010 Queen’s Birthday Honours list is published today, recognising outstanding achievement and service across the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The selection of these names was carried out by the independent committees during the previous administration.  But the current Prime Minister did, in accordance with the normal practice, submit them to The Queen for approval.</p>

<p>This is one of the most diverse lists yet, reflecting the make-up of the population. The number of women in the list has increased further from 45% at New Year 2010 to 47% in this round.</p>

<p>The majority of awards have gone to extraordinary people from a wide range of fields who have made a real difference to life in their communities. The list includes an Ironman champion, an owl conservationist, a flying bank clerk and the resident organist at the Tower Ballroom in Blackpool.</p>

<p>This year 336 (56%) of the MBEs on the list were put forward by members of the general public, with nominations coming in from up and down the country.</p>

<p>In total 975 people have been recommended to The Queen for an award:</p>

<ul>
  <li>836 candidates have been selected at MBE and OBE level, 598 at MBE and 238 at OBE.</li>
  <li>76% of the recipients are people who have undertaken outstanding work in their local communities.</li>
  <li>There are 460 successful women candidates in the list, including 11 Dames, 33 CBEs and one CB. This represents 47% of the total.</li>
  <li>7.3% per cent of the successful candidates come from ethnic minority communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the big names being honoured there is a CBE for Oscar winning actress <strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong> and an OBE for playwright, author and critic <strong>Bonnie Greer</strong>.

<p>But most of the awards are for ordinary people who have gone that extra mile to make a difference to the lives of people around them.</p>

<p>Among the community candidates there is a knighthood for Robert Murray, for services to football and education in the North East. His Sunderland Foundation has now worked with over 150,000 young people in the UK’s most successful football based community programme.</p>

Using R, generate 100 simulations of 30 samples each from a distribution (other than normal) of your choice.  Graph the sampling distribution of means.  Graph the sampling distribution of the minimum. Share your graphs and your R code. What did the simulation of the means demonstrate?  What about the distribution of the minimum...?  

```{r}
set.seed(123)

means = replicate(100, mean(rexp(30)))
mins = replicate(100, min(rexp(30)))

hist(means)
hist(mins)
```

The distribution of the means appears normally distributed; while the distribution of the minimums is shaped like the exponential distribution probablity density.

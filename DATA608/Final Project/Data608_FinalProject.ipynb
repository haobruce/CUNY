    "As you can see in the chart below, the S&P 500, which is a broad index of U.S. stocks has been on an almost uninterrupted tear since the Great Recession of 2008. It has eclipsed the peaks of the tech bubble of late 90s and the debt-fueled boom in the mid 2000s, and it continues to set new record highs week after week, month after month. \n",

    "With asset prices at these record levels, it's hard to imagine very strong expected returns in the future (although people have been saying that for years now and have been wrong for just as long). As a result, we do see new asset classes entering the mainstream. While real estate became an asset class in the 2000, the 2010s have seen the entrance of new asset classes, like marketplace lending (e.g. Lending Club), crowd-funded angel investing (e.g. Angel's List) and now cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin). \n",

Today we'll cover one such strategy, trading futures within an algorithmic trading system.

    "1. Selecting various instruments, in this case various futures contracts, e.g. corn, gold, natural gas, European STOXX, Eurodollar and European VSTOXX (volatility) futures [symbols: YC, MGC, QG, FESX, ED and FVS, respectively] \n",
    "2. Applying various trading strategies, i.e. algorithms to determine how much to buy or sell of a given instrument. This system uses a trend following strategy and a carry strategy. As the name suggests, a trend following strategy profits when instrument prices follow a trend. A carry strategy profits when instrument prices remain unchanged.  \n",
    "3. Applying a risk and portfolio management algorithm that combines the buy/sell signals of the various instrument trading strategies while balancing the relative risk/reward of each instrument trading strategy and the correlations between them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Output**: The code and visualizations are intended to shed light on the following: \n",
    "1. How are the data acquired? \n",
    "2. How is a trend following strategy implemented for a given instrument? \n",
    "3. How has the overall trading system performed since the beginning of 2017? "
